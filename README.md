## Info

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

In this project, we worked on a project for a fictional company that requires my help building a **Bookstore-Redux** using react. The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements we must meet.

The full project requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/project-redux-bookstore/blob/master/README.md).

## Backend

For the backend we've used rails. For now you can add a book and remove it. You can see our rails-api app [here](https://github.com/ebukaume/bookstore-api)

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
- npm
- React-Create-App
- SCSS

### ✨ [Live Demo](https://bookstore-react-redux.herokuapp.com)

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YemreAybey/bookstore-redux.git
```

> cd into the directory, install dependencies, build and start

```sh
$ cd basic-bookstore-redux
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
